# Game Engine Project

## Overview

I'm developing this project in **Visual Studio 2022** using the following technologies:
- **Vulkan SDK**
- **GLFW**
- **GLM**

The main objective of this project is to create the starting point of a game engine for **studying purposes**. 

## Current State

In its current state, the project **won't work properly** because I haven't committed the necessary library files to run it. 

## Installation Guide

If you want to run this project, you'll need to set up the development environment by following the installation guide provided in the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/en/Development_environment).
